    "constraint:n engineering design, particularly in the use of computer-aided drafting and design, in the creation of 3D assemblies and multibody systems, the plural term \"constraints\" refers to demarcations of geometrical characteristics between two or more entities or solid modeling bodies; these delimiters are intentional in defining diverse properties of theoretical physical position and motion, or displacement. In addition, 2D sketches -including the ones used to create extrusions and solid bodies- can also be constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "backtracking search：Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In constraint satisfaction, local consistency conditions are properties of constraint satisfaction problems related to the consistency of subsets of variables or constraints. They can be used to reduce the search space and make the problem easier to solve. Various kinds of local consistency conditions are leveraged, including node consistency, arc consistency, and path consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "backjumping：In backtracking algorithms, backjumping is a technique that reduces search space, therefore increasing efficiency. While backtracking always goes up one level in the search tree when all values for a variable have been tested, backjumping may go up more levels. In this article, a fixed order of evaluation of variables {\\displaystyle x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n}} x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n} is used, but the same considerations apply to a dynamic order of evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "min-conflicts：In computer science, the min conflicts algorithm is a search algorithm or heuristic method to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSP).Given an initial assignment of values to all the variables of a CSP, the algorithm randomly selects a variable from the set of variables with conflicts violating one or more constraints of the CSP. Then it assigns to this variable the value that minimizes the number of conflicts. If there is more than one value with a minimum number of conflicts, it chooses one randomly. This process of random variable selection and min-conflict value assignment is iterated until a solution is found or a pre-selected maximum number of iterations is reached.Because a CSP can be interpreted as a local search problem when all the variables have an assigned value (called a complete state), the min conflicts algorithm can be seen as a repair heuristic that chooses the state with the minimum number of conflicts.\n",
